If you were unable to attend the October 29th meetup at BarcelonaJS to see Brisa's presentation, here we have uploaded a recorded version so you can watch it.

It was a very important day for most of the Brisa team. It's a pity that [Enzo](https://github.com/enzonotario) and [A.Matias](https://github.com/amatiasq) could not attend because they live far away, hopefully in the future we can all get together.

In the talk, as the creator of Brisa, I make a presentation explaining more in depth its concepts and making a couple of short demos to see these concepts in code. The part I liked the most was seeing people's enthusiasm to try it, their curiosity and the great questions they asked.

I am really happy about the community that we are creating, I am sure that in the next months we will finish defining the [1.0 version routemap](https://github.com/brisa-build/brisa/issues/197) together with the proposals of the community.
