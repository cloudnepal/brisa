This release focuses on addressing two critical regressions introduced in the previous versions:

## Select-Option bug üêõ

We have fixed a bug that caused the select-option default selected value to not be rendered correctly.

## Hot reload wasn‚Äôt feeling so "hot" ü•µ

We have fixed some issues related to hot-reload that caused actions conflicts during hot-reload, and hot-reload was not working as expected.
