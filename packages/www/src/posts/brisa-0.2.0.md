We‚Äôre thrilled to announce **Brisa 0.2.0**, a minor milestone in Brisa's journey. This release introduces **official support for Deno**, alongside multiple performance optimizations and important fixes. Let's dive into the highlights!

## üöÄ Deno Support

Brisa now officially supports [**Deno**](/building-your-application/building/deno-server) as an output target. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

- **Output Configuration:** Use `output: 'deno'` in your `brisa.config.ts` to build for Deno.
- **Deno-Specific Configurations:** Brisa leverages `deno.json` for custom setups, automatically placed in your build directory.
- **CLI Integration:** Running `brisa start` detects the Deno output and uses `Deno.serve` for serving your application.

Brisa every time is more JS runtime agnostic, and we are excited to see how you will use it with Deno!
